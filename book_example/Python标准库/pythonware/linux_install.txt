PythonWorks EVALUATION 1.2 for Unix (Linux and Solaris sparc)
====================================================================

PythonWorks is an Integrated Development Environment for Python,
developed by Secret Labs AB.

This is PythonWorks 1.2, for RedHat Linux 6.2/SUSE6.4/Solaris.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To update PythonWorks, first remove the old (1.1) version:

	rpm -e pythonworks-test-1.1-YYYYMDD
	
	(where YYYYMMDD is the build date of the pythonworks
	 that you've downloaded )

If you have an early pre-release, use:

    rpm -e pythonworks-test-1.1-alpha )
     	
To install Pythonworks release 1.x with builddate YYYYMMDD:

	rpm -i pythonworks-test-1.x-YYYYMMDD.i386.rpm

    NOTE: on Unix, make sure you're logged in as a user with
    root priviliges.  The installation may not work properly if
    you're running as an ordinary "User".

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting the application

There should be a symbolic link from either /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin,
that is created during installation.

Either:

Type pythonworks-test at a command line, if it fails check your PATH in the following manner:

Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH.
If /usr/local/bin does not exist, check that the symbolic link (pythonworks-test)
is present in the /usr/bin directory and that this directory is in your PATH.

or alternatively:

Try the full path to the pythonworks startup script:
	/opt/pythonworks-test/pythonworks.sh


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Activating your copy of PythonWorks 

If you have already loaded the ticket and PythonWorks is fully
functional, just skip this section.  If not, then read on.

1.  If necessary, click on the "home" button to get back to the
    PythonWorks home page.  If you've opened a project, you must
    close it first (click on the "X" button in the project browser,
    or select "close" on the project's home page).

2.  Click on the "load license ticket" link.

3.  In your mail program, save the ticket message to disk, and
    use the "Load from file..." button in the PythonWorks license
    manager to load the ticket.

4.  Check that the ticket details appear in the license manager
    window, and click "OK" to close the license manager.
